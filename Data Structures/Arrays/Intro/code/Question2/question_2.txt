Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits). 
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits). 
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits). 
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771]
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 500
1 <= nums[i] <= 105

How to compute the number of digits of a number ?
Divide the number by 10 again and again to get the number of digits.

solution 2.2 is the best. 2 and 2.1 are okay. 2.3 is the worst.
