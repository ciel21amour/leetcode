Inserting in array means shifting elements on the left to the left side of the array by one space.

 example : 

Say we want to insert the element at index 2.
First, we will have to create space for the new element.

for (int i = 4; i >= 2; i--)
{
    // Shift each element one position to the right.
    intArray[i + 1] = intArray[i];
}

Now that we have created space for the new element,
we can insert it at the required index.

intArray[2] = 30;


question 2: 
// for merging of sorted array, create a copy of the first array and then use it. --> no need to worry about elements in nums1
